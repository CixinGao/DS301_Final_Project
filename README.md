# DS301_Final_Project
This repo contains the final project for DS301 in NYU 2025 spring

## Project Title:
ResMLP ODE for Time Series Forecasting

## Project Team Member:
Ning Chen, Sijing He, Cixin Gao

## Project Description:

## Repository and Code Structure:
Foe this repository, we had "ResMLP+ODE.ipynb" as the main coding, "goldprice2001.2.1--2024.1.1.xlsx" as the dataset.
The baseline model that used to compare with ResMLP+ODE was in "补充在这里file name"
The "Hyperparameter Tuning Result.xlsx" is file that shows our ResMLP+ODE hyperparameter tuning result and why we chose such a hyperparameter group as the final model.

## Example commands to execute the code:
Our Python code is designed to run in Google Colab.
To execute it properly, we recommend downloading both the .ipynb notebook and the associated .csv data files and uploading them to Colab.
First, open the notebook in Colab. Then, use the file panel on the left to upload the .csv file under the “Files” tab. Once uploaded, the code should run smoothly with access to the data.
